## Definitions of Genetic Terminology

Professor Lander, from MITx 7.

### Gene

Discrete factors of inheritance.

### Allele

Alternative types of a gene aA, bB etc. Each organism has two alleles for each gene.
Alle les are _not_ dominant or recessive - phenotypes are.

### Genotype

specified by which two alleles one has at a particular gene.

### Homozygote

Same alleles: AA or aa etc

### Heterozygote

Different alleles: Aa, Bb etc.

### Phenotype  

Appearance, trait. 
Some are dominant over others, eg round seed colour over wrinkled.
F1 hybrid is dominant over 2 if hybrid between the two has phenotype 1, not 2.

_Phenotypes_ are dominant or recessive, _not_ alleles.
